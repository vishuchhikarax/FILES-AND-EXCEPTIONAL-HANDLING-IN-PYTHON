        "1. What's the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "-> A: In interpreted languages like Python, code runs line-by-line, which is great for quick testing and debugging. Compiled languages like C++ convert the whole code into machine language before running, making them faster but less flexible for quick changes.\n",
        "2. How does Python handle errors or exceptions?\n",
        "-> A: Python uses something called exception handling to deal with errors that might occur while your program is running. You can use try and except blocks to catch and respond to these errors without crashing your whole program.\n",
        "3. Why do we use the 'finally' block in exception handling?\n",
        "-> A: The 'finally' block is used when you want some code to run no matter what—whether there's an error or not. It's great for cleanup actions like closing files or connections.\n",
        "4. What's logging in Python all about?\n",
        "-> A: Logging is like a smarter version of print statements. It helps track events, errors, or any useful information as your program runs. It's super helpful for debugging and monitoring.\n",
        "5. Why is the '__del__' method important in Python?\n",
        "-> A: The '__del__' method is called when an object is about to be deleted. It's often used to clean up things like open files or network connections before the object is gone.\n",
        "6. What's the difference between 'import module' and 'from module import something'?\n",
        "-> A: 'import module' brings in the whole module, and you'll access its contents using dot notation. 'from module import something' only brings in the part you need, making your code shorter.\n",
        "7. Can Python handle more than one type of error at once?\n",
        "-> A: Absolutely! You can catch multiple types of exceptions using a tuple, or just use multiple except blocks for different error types.\n",
        "8. Why should we use the 'with' statement when working with files?\n",
        "-> A: 'With' handles opening and closing files automatically. It's a safer and cleaner way to deal with files because it ensures they're properly closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "9. How are multithreading and multiprocessing different?\n",
        "-> A: Multithreading is best for tasks involving waiting (like downloading files), and all threads share the same memory. Multiprocessing is better for CPU-heavy tasks and uses separate memory spaces for each process.\n",
        "10. Why bother with logging at all?\n",
        "-> A: Logging gives you a history of what your program did and when—perfect for finding bugs or understanding how things went wrong.\n",
        "11. What do we mean by memory management in Python?\n",
        "-> A: It's how Python allocates and frees up memory as your program runs. Python handles most of this automatically using garbage collection.\n",
        "12. What steps should I follow to handle exceptions properly?\n",
        "-> A: Wrap your risky code in a try block, catch errors with except, optionally use else for successful runs, and finally for cleanups.\n",
        "13. Why should I care about memory management?\n",
        "-> A: Good memory management keeps your program running smoothly and avoids slowdowns or crashes due to memory leaks.\n",
        "14. How do try and except blocks work together?\n",
        "-> A: 'Try' is where you put code that might fail, and 'except' tells Python what to do if it does fail. It keeps your program from crashing.\n",
        "15. How does Python know when to free up memory?\n",
        "-> A: Python uses a system called garbage collection. It automatically removes objects that are no longer being used.\n",
        "16. What's the use of the 'else' block in exception handling?\n",
        "-> A: 'Else' runs only if the try block didn't raise an error. It's useful for code that should only run if everything went smoothly.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "-> A: The main levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They help you filter the importance of log messages.\n",
        "18. How is 'os.fork()' different from using the multiprocessing module?\n",
        "-> A: 'os.fork()' is Unix-only and lower-level. 'multiprocessing' is cross-platform and easier to use for creating new processes.\n",
        "19. Why is it important to close a file after opening it?\n",
        "-> A: Closing a file saves data and releases system resources. Not doing so can cause data loss or memory issues.\n",
        "20. What's the difference between read() and readline()?\n",
        "-> A: read() pulls in the entire file content, while readline() just gives you one line at a time.\n",
        "21. What does the logging module actually do?\n",
        "-> A: It helps you keep track of what your program is doing by logging messages to the console or a file.\n",
        "22. How does the os module help with file handling?\n",
        "-> A: The os module lets you work with files and directories—like creating, renaming, or navigating them on your system.\n",
        "23. What makes memory management tricky in Python?\n",
        "-> A: Things like circular references or holding onto objects too long can make it hard to free up memory, especially in long-running programs.\n",
        "24. How do I throw an error myself in Python?\n",
        "-> A: Use the raise keyword followed by the error you want to throw, like this: raise ValueError('Something went wrong').\n",
        "25. When should I use multithreading?\n",
        "-> A: Multithreading is great when you're dealing with things like waiting for input or network responses. It helps your program stay responsive.\n"
